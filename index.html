    <h2>
      Resist the hords and conquer the world!
    </h2>
    <p>Conqueror's Crown: New Horizon is an awesome RTS video game in which you are lockdown in a place where every now and then a horde of orcs will attack you. Make a good strategy and stay alive as much as possible!</p>
      <h4>Fortify your base and survive the hords...</h4>
      <p>Build walls to protect your base, put your soldiers inside and resist the orc waves.</p>
      <h4>..or prepare your army to destroy their bases!</h4>
      <p>Create a powerful army and go all over the map to destroy enemy bases to reach the glory.</p>
      <h4>Collect resources and explore the whole map</h4>
      <p>Make your gatherers work tirelessly to take resources such as gold, stone or wood. But watch out! They are limited, so go throught the map to find more mines, forests and quarrys.
